tcprstat is a pcap-based tool that extracts information about TCP response
times.

It works by sniffing for TCP "requests" (inbound packets) and measures the time
that it takes for sending a "response" (next outbound packet). While this
approach might seem too simple, it works for simple protocols that are based in
such request/response system, like HTTP and the MySQL protocol. In the future,
we may write more complex protocol decoding.

tcprstat sniffs for a while, and then shows some stats about the sniffed
packets, similar to the way top(1) works.

tcprstat uses libpcap to capture TCP. Due to many distros not shipping
libpcap >= 1.0.0, tcprstat ships libpcap 1.1.1 and uses it if it can't find a
suitable version

The build process delivers a static version, tcprstat-static, with no external
linking (some castration is needed at libpcap) so it can be copied directly to
a server with no need for compilation tools.

tcprstat is released under the GPL, version 2 or 3.
